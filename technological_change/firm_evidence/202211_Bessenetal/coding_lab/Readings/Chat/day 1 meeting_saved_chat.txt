	Hi Prof. Scott. I have challenges installing Discord, so I will have to use my zoom to communicate. Could please also post information to zoom? Thanks
08:01:03 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	Discord? I did not get those instructions… anythingn we have to install before hand?
08:01:48 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	once discord is installed.. how do we connect to the course?
08:01:54 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	It

08:04:39 From Rahma Ahmed to Everyone:
	mine is an infinite loop of captcha authentication
08:04:58 From Rahma Ahmed to Everyone:
	so I can’t even install it as someone else mentioned

08:59:14 From Emily Conover to Everyone:
	Is there any information on whether one company was charging lower rates?

	Sorry — I’m getting there.
10:08:17 From Scott Cunningham to Joe(Direct Message):
	It’s not an easy question to answer per se
10:08:26 From Scott Cunningham to Joe(Direct Message):
	The lab identifies the ATE and the DiD identifies the ATT
10:08:27 From Melissa Staha to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	All the stuff called the non-parallel trends bias in 2x2 case
10:08:52 From Scott Cunningham to Melissa Staha(Direct Message):
	You mean that red term?
10:09:12 From Scott Cunningham to Melissa Staha(Direct Message):
	Basically, that second row is the object that contaminates your estimate
10:09:22 From Scott Cunningham to Melissa Staha(Direct Message):
	And in order for that to not do that, you need those four things to sum to zero
10:09:26 From Melissa Staha to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	No, the whole thing. And you asked what we are doing and someone said differencing out the time trend.
10:09:35 From Scott Cunningham to Melissa Staha(Direct Message):
	Yeah “differencing out the time trend” isn’t right
10:09:38 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	What's the full name of the two, ATE & ATT
10:09:56 From Melissa Staha to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	thanks
10:10:05 From Scott Cunningham to Melissa Staha(Direct Message):
	I think what they meant to say or what I interpreted them as saying is that the counterfactual trend trend must equal the real trend for the comparison group
10:10:22 From Scott Cunningham to Joe(Direct Message):
	Average treatment effect (ATE) and Average treatment effect on the treated group (ATT)
10:10:23 From Melissa Staha to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Ok, I have that written down too. thanks!
10:10:27 From Scott Cunningham to Joe(Direct Message):
	The ATE is for everyone.
10:10:38 From Scott Cunningham to Joe(Direct Message):
	The ATT is the causal effect, though, just for our treatment group

10:46:21 From Antonio Ramos to Everyone:
	we  don't
10:46:29 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	those big differences could be the same post period in the parallel trends calculation
10:46:47 From Chip to Everyone:
	there could be selection bias in the estimator
10:46:54 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Unparallel pre-trends does not matter I suppose.
10:46:56 From Antonio Ramos to Everyone:
	yes
10:47:34 From L Woskie to Everyone:
	Can you share your updated excel doc when we’re done?
10:47:51 From Antonio Ramos to Everyone:
	if the paralel time time trends is violated after the intervention
10:48:09 From Antonio Ramos to Everyone:
	then we get selection bias
10:49:15 From Setu Pelz to Everyone:
	We can
10:49:15 From Sophia Hatz to Everyone:
	the probability of receiving treatment needs to be the same across the two groups. So we hope the pre-trend differences are not indicative of a difference in probability of being treated
10:51:00 From Setu Pelz to Everyone:
	The pre trend doesn't matter if we can somehow say that the parallel trends holds post treatment. But this is something we cant really ever prove because we don't have Y^0 for treated group post treatment.
10:51:02 From Purushottam Mohanty to Everyone:
	The probability of treatment need not be the same across the two groups for DID. It’s perfectly okay to choose treatment for a lower or higher level group.
10:53:24 From Melissa Staha to Everyone:
	Parallel trends: Post treatment, the pre-trend parallel trends should continue if there’s no treatment
10:53:39 From Purushottam Mohanty to Everyone:
	Parallel trends assumption just mentions that if pre-treatment period trends are similar then it might be okay to assume that the groups will trend the same post treatment. It cannot be tested of course.
10:53:51 From Sophia Hatz to Everyone:
	I mean that we don’t want there to be systematic differences across the two groups that could explain their selection into treatment and the difference in outcome. Isn’t checking parallel trends sort of like a balance test?
10:54:21 From Christian Caballero to Everyone:
	but we can not observe the parallel trend post treatment, we can only hope (asume) so if we observe parallel pre
10:59:58 From Chip to Everyone:
	GRoup 2 servbes as a good counterfactual in the first example but not in the new one
11:00:27 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	What’s disturbing is that, with a conventional pre-trends plot, it would look like the DiD is an unbiased estimate of the ATT!
11:01:25 From Abdelrahman Amer to Everyone:
	i guess pre-trends are neither necessary nor sufficient, but they can help us sell the story of parallel trends post treatment
11:04:22 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	its a ceteris paribus statement right? if it is satisfied before we assume it is satisfied afterwards
11:04:37 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	Hard to imagine a scenario where you wouldn’t have parallel pre trends BUT have 0 parallel trend bias
11:04:50 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	plus we control for anything we think is relevant and may change
11:07:27 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	Also shows the importance of “placebo outcomes.” If some outcome Z that isn’t effected by treatment also shows a jump in 1986, then thats evidence of something else going on
11:14:04 From Christian Caballero to Everyone:
	As I see it now, all causal inference methods (PO or SCM) rely on assumptions, and as such we can not verify them.		Here, parallen trends IS an assumption that we can not verify
11:14:16 From Setu Pelz to Everyone:
	You would need a case where not treat all of those people who have the same reason for being treated, are treated, right?
11:15:12 From Soodeh Saberian to Everyone:
	Is not this Ashenfelter dip?
11:18:52 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Very clear explanations, Scott
11:19:00 From Franckie to Everyone:
	Thanks!
11:28:51 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	How confident can we be to say that if the treatment assignment is NOT randomly done, there will not be a pre-trend parallel trends. And, if we know what affects the treatment assignment so that we can tease it out, would that mean that we can correct the pre-parallel trends as parallel, conditional on those factors affecting the treatment assignment?
11:34:07 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Thanks!
11:43:39 From Franckie to Everyone:
	wow
11:48:24 From Karla Savina to Everyone:
	AWESOME!
11:50:39 From Setu Pelz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	This has been a step change few hours for me Prof Cunningham. I really get some of the fundamentals now. You are an amazing teacher. I think many others had this same outcome.
12:48:17 From Scott Cunningham to Setu Pelz(Direct Message):
	Thanks so much setu
12:48:25 From Scott Cunningham to Setu Pelz(Direct Message):
	I really appreciate you saying that.
12:48:32 From Scott Cunningham to Setu Pelz(Direct Message):
	I only added this last night (the exercise).
12:48:46 From Scott Cunningham to Setu Pelz(Direct Message):
	I could tell something wasn’t clicking
12:50:43 From Setu Pelz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	It is a powerful didactic tool Sir! I never understood the PT assumption correctly before this.
12:51:54 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Been thinking about it while eating 🙂, Let's say,
12:52:17 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	1) there is a pre-parellel trand,
12:59:38 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	2) but the treatment assignment is not random, say that the level difference between the treated group and the control group in the outcome in the pre-period actually motivated the treatment. (i.e., in the pre-period, the HH income was lower in the treated group and because of that, (with some mechanism) the outcome of interest for the treated group is systematically lower than that for the control group. (but they are parallel). And now because of the income difference, there will be a policy change, which is the treatment, for the treated group. So, the treatment assignment is not random. If this is the case, would the DID estimator for the ATT for the policy be biased? Please share your thought with me, when you have time for your lecture convenience!
13:03:02 From Luis Quintero to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	scott for some reason I need to restart the computer due to zoom.. I will be back in 5 min… letting you know just in case you need to let me back in
13:03:08 From Scott Cunningham to Setu Pelz(Direct Message):

13:05:30 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	If we can do the DiD calculation directly, in what condition do we need to use OLS?
13:12:26 From Sophia Hatz to Everyone:
	Does this mean that any “fixed effect" regression assumes parallel trends?
13:16:23 From Christian Caballero to Everyone:
	teh counterfactual
13:16:35 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	The unobserved Y0 for NJ
13:16:41 From Roberto González to Everyone:
	What would have happened had NJ not received treatment
13:16:54 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Hypothetical untreated NJ average outcome.
13:17:49 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	The slope between YO pre and post PA is the same as the sloper between YO pre and hypothetical YO post NJ
13:21:11 From Christian Caballero to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	However, the _trajectory_ between before and after doesn't have to be linear though?
13:21:13 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	So it also helps to give some institutional arugments why something is a good counterfactual as well
13:22:49 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Thanks
13:22:49 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	just to reiterate… looking at the data is not a way of confirming that PT held right? it requires knowing the context (and being able to justify it)
13:27:56 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	If we were looking at state unemployment rates every month, that would be panel. But if we are using CPS data where we have the employment status of many people in every month-state, that would be repeated cross section?
13:33:02 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	We will get to this later, but this seems different from how the Calloway Santanna estimator understands these terms in Stata
13:49:06 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Like administrative units have been redistricted… The measure of features of interest has changed as a result. It violates PT assumption.
13:51:00 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	If treatment is occurring at the state level but you have county level variation, is this repeated cross section? The unit of analysis being more granular than the level of treatment is how I’ve heard repeated cross section vs panel discussed in the past...
13:53:02 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	What’s the meaning of compositional difference?
13:54:59 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	I know this is not the point that you are making here, but speaking of handling that source of endogeneity in this case, can we just control for the age and call it a day?
13:56:42 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Different people/unit of observation year on year sounds like having infinitely many potential outcomes and finding a suitable comparison group becomes all the more thorny
13:57:15 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	You can use Oster (2017) to bound the bias for compositional differences based on how the coefficients change when you control for things like age vs. when you don't
13:57:35 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Hence a violation of PT?
13:58:57 From Jungkyu Suh to Everyone:
	the Hong 2011 paper itself seems to recognize the compositional problem and use some kind of matching estimator (the “DDM” estimator). Do you think s/he solves the problem this way?
13:58:59 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Ok
13:59:09 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	(Here's the Oster paper:) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2016.1227711?casa_token=X9B4Eb_KKCgAAAAA%3AnSApIItAGu7jIkFmC4mi-vxPOuAB4OU5NdnwalcDPjU3ou2m2S87S4BMnFHyuVE7D7fYNRRG1KrC
13:59:50 From Jungkyu Suh to Everyone:
	ok.
14:02:13 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	I'm still a little stuck thinking about measurement error 🙂 I could imagine that a policy intervention comes with some kind of increased monitoring of the treated units. The monitoring itself could affect the treatment groups trajectory, or could mean the data available on the treatment group differs systematically from the control.
14:02:25 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	I think you’re on to something though
14:02:48 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	I think the key may be to use that excel spreadsheet and just ask yourself if there is something that would cause Y0 to change even if the ATT=0
14:03:04 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	yes, that clarifies
14:03:17 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	I think that will then cause the treatment to be dependent on the error term too btw
14:03:47 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	so maybe its just plain measurement error
14:03:57 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	I think it creates an mechanical correlation iow between the error and the treatment bc the issue is the treatment changes values at precisely the moment when Y0 is changing anyway
14:04:15 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	Yes but I think you still have to frame it as ‘measurement error starts now for this group but not this one'
14:04:35 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	A very systematic measurement error
14:06:13 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	Yes
14:06:38 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	I would think measurement error needs to have a documented source too
14:06:55 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	It might be interesting though to run a simulation and see how this works out
14:07:31 From Scott Cunningham to Sophia Hatz(Direct Message):
	I may play around with it and see what I can make happen.  You basically want the draws of the variable to come from maybe something with wider variance or something after treatment starts
14:07:33 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	good idea

	Oh interesting. What is this about?
14:13:34 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	measurement problems and human rights
14:17:42 From Luis Quintero to Everyone:
	these std errors discussion is specifically about DiD right? or are the results in that paper general?
14:27:31 From Jacob Moore to Everyone:
	So a convincing argument here for pre trends would be our ex-ante coefficient is estimated as zero
14:27:39 From Jacob Moore to Everyone:
	?
14:32:44 From Shae Ayse Cetinel to Everyone:
	This is what Sun&Abraham paper comes up with?
14:34:04 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	The leading event study DiD coefficients, if they equal 0, are showing that in the pre period, the treated group is where the counterfactual says they should be
14:34:19 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	So, from the OLS perspective, after taking two differences with the two fixed effects, thus DiD, there is nothing left to explain before treatment, which means that they are parallel, right?
14:38:41 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	Can imagine running a traditional DiD with a post*treat estimator, but just pretending the treatment took place 2 years prior to when it really did
14:38:50 From Franckie to Everyone:
	Are there adjustments that can be made for differential trends?
14:39:19 From Melissa Staha to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Is this similar to placebo-in-time in that you’re moving the treatment back to make sure parallel trends hold with data you have
14:39:19 From Shae Ayse Cetinel to Everyone:
	if there are multiple treated groups then do we need to check each group's mu hat ?
14:40:01 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Could we briefly go through the specification of event study regression again? Thanks, Scott.
14:42:06 From Shae Ayse Cetinel to Everyone:
	no I think they need to be statistically insignificant
14:49:28 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Earlier we discussed 2X2. Is that common to test two variables at a time in the DiD? Eg. minimum wage and location; insurance and age?
14:54:27 From Sophia Hatz to Everyone:
	is it kind of like showing compliance?
14:54:30 From Jens Christian Haatvedt to Everyone:
	Bite is like a mechanism from treatment to outcome?
14:54:56 From kevin williams to Everyone:
	definitely like first stage
14:59:09 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	For event study, can we study more than one events? Eg. Medicaid and pandemic?
15:03:53 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	Does anyone ever do a difference in coefficients test on the lead vs. lags?
15:03:55 From Christian Caballero to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Does the treatment have to be 1 for all times from 0 to m? Or can we extend the estimation of the \deltas beyond the end of the treatment to estimate a kind of "residual" effect?
15:04:35 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	just as wald test of the two coefficients
15:04:37 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	yeah
15:05:11 From Emily Conover to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	The SE tend to get larger further away from zero, is this due to sample size or something else?
15:05:51 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	I'm more thinking of the case where the standard errors are larger on the leads
15:06:44 From Muthoni Ngatia to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Does it matter if treatment is staggered, so there are different # of observations for each lead and lag?
15:06:52 From basuroys to Everyone:
	is this QJE data available?
15:07:08 From Tomer Stern to Everyone:
	I think if it “turns off” after three years, I think you can just set lead3+ equal to 0 and then that unit drops out of your regression when estimating lag4. But not sure
15:10:02 From Yongseok Kim to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	I wonder if there is another way to run an event study with just a list of indicators (dummies) for each period before and after the treatment. I think I have seen papers running an event study that way.
15:11:32 From Cameron Ellis to Everyone:
	This is the case I was thinking of for a difference in coefficients test
15:14:45 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Seems the scales of these two visualization are different.
15:19:09 From Devika Hazra to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	1. For event studies, if we don’t see a jump at t=0 but let’s say at t = 4, is that a meaningful result?
	
	2. You explained that for the lead coefficients, we are mainly concerned about whether they are close to 0. For the lag coefficients, is the significance level important?
15:19:43 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Does my understanding of event study regression is correct: The event study regression is one framework to study the pre-treatment trends of the DiD model by including DID estimates for several leads (years on the left of treatment year).
15:22:04 From Scott Cunningham to Devika Hazra(Direct Message):
	That’s a meaningful result.  Under PT, all the lags are ATT parameters for that particular period.  It would mean the effect (under PT) occurred four years later
15:22:22 From Scott Cunningham to Devika Hazra(Direct Message):
	Significance will only be relevant for making statements about its sign
15:22:30 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Would the 2x2 DiD just be the average of the lag year coefficients?
15:22:44 From Devika Hazra to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Thanks!
15:22:58 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	Zheng - that’s correct.
15:23:30 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	The event study is largely a way of illustrating elements that we have tended to want to see in a DiD — similar pretends suggestive (but not guaranteeing nor necessary to have) PT.
15:23:47 From Sophia Hatz to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Actually this is the paper I was thinking about: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/changing-standard-of-accountability-and-the-positive-relationship-between-human-rights-treaty-ratification-and-compliance/46C01A80D73D90BFC73BDC88D9B4C77D
	
	
	Say I want to estimate the effect of a country ratifying UN human rights treaty on its rate of human rights abuses. Different countries ratify at different points in time. But, the standard of accountability also changes over time, so that monitoring agencies increasingly hold states responsible for repression. Plus, countries that ratify are probably more likely to comply with monitoring after they ratify, so it their rate of human rights abuses are systematically higher compared to the control. or something.
15:24:42 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	Not exactly.
15:24:50 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	There are issues with implicit weighting procedures that are done.
15:24:58 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	We get into this in more detail tomorrow with Callaway and sant'anna
15:25:04 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	But you can average them
15:25:23 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	And that would be a uniformly weighted average over all the time period ATTs
15:25:57 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Thanks Scott. I appreciate it.
15:29:11 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Thank you!
15:34:56 From Christina St to Everyone:
	Can I find the DID Summer Course of John Roth on his Twitter account? Thank you!

15:35:08 From Scott Cunningham to Everyone:
	Scroll down to his
15:43:27 From Jacob Moore to Everyone:
	So the DDD part of your book is where I got a bit hung up. Can you (at some point) elaborate the practical difference between running a DD on the high income folks (instead of the original low income folks) vs the DDD approach that incorporates both group? Is the advantage of DDD more convincing falsification by jointly estimating the parameters/ standard errors in that model vs estimating two separate models w/DD?
15:54:00 From Jacob Moore to Everyone:
	Amazing, this is all cleared up -- cheers
15:54:11 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Very clear, Scott!
15:55:53 From Lubna Naz to Everyone:
	Excellent explanation, Scott!
15:59:12 From Shae Ayse Cetinel to Everyone:
	can we say that heterogeneity within each group remains the same except the effect cause by the treatment
16:02:59 From Chip Vega to Everyone:
	Suppose you suspect contamination from the NJ_t, high wage earners, does it make sense to do a falsification test and see if the effect is significant or not? 
16:03:45 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Isn't this example using more than one event (variable)? minimum wage, L H wage, location?
16:04:22 From Abdelrahman Amer to Everyone:
	SUTVA?
16:06:02 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	What’s the D in D3 column?
16:14:07 From Saied Toossi to Everyone:
	you're muted
16:14:52 From Franckie to Everyone:
	Transcript of this meeting?
16:24:40 From Saied Toossi to Everyone:
	if you don't believe PT holds in panel A, presumably you don't believe it holds for panel B, so then how does doing the triple diff make you or anyone else more confident? Seems like triple diff's are more difficult to defend then diff-diff
16:25:49 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Assumption of PT in DiD is different… I guess it depends on which PT assumption you believe more…
16:26:51 From Richard Gretz to Everyone:
	ATT
16:26:51 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	ATT
16:28:39 From Kiril Chilingarashvili to Everyone:
	If the conclusions are so much dependent on subjective beliefs, how the DiD technique drives the conclusion from less convincing to more convincing? 	Is the trick - we are reducing complex problem to small problem where we only have to prove PT assumption in specific setup?
16:37:37 From Saied Toossi to Everyone:
	I think framing it that way makes it clearer for me, thanks Scott
16:38:52 From Saied Toossi to Everyone:
	interesting, the placebo analogy was great, thanks!
16:39:18 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	Can you say the interpretation again in this DDD result?
16:41:24 From Saied Toossi to Everyone:
	exactly
16:43:33 From Zheng Zhang to Everyone:
	Very clear explanations, Scott! Thanks a lot!
16:48:20 From Joe to Scott Cunningham(Direct Message):
	How you interpret the DDD coefficient?
16:48:27 From Scott Cunningham to Joe(Direct Message):
	As the ATT
16:51:43 From kevin williams to Everyone:
	give me a punchline, scott
16:52:52 From Sophia Hatz to Everyone:
	Damned diff you do, damned diff you don’t
16:53:34 From Nicola Nones to Everyone:
